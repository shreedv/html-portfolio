<h1>The Best Binge-watch-worthy series/movies According to Divya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>YOU</h3>
<p>
  I like You because it's a perfect mix of psychological thriller, mystery, and
  dark romance. The way the story is told from Joe Goldberg's perspective makes
  it even more intriguing, giving a deep dive into his obsessive yet calculated
  mind. The series keeps me hooked with its unpredictable twists, intense
  storytelling, and morally complex characters. Every season adds new layers to
  the story, making it impossible to stop watching. It's thrilling, creepy, and
  oddly addictive!

<h3>OK JAANU</h3>
<p>
  I like OK Jaanu because it's a lighthearted and feel-good romantic movie with
  great chemistry between Aditya Roy Kapur and Shraddha Kapoor. The story
  explores modern relationships, dreams, and the struggles of balancing love
  with career ambitions. The music by A.R. Rahman adds so much charm, especially
  songs like Enna Sona and The Humma Song. It's a sweet, refreshing watch that
  perfectly captures the essence of young love and the excitement of new
  beginnings!
</p>
<h3>MONEY HEIST</h3>
<p>
  Money Heist is an intense, brilliantly written heist drama with mind-blowing
  twists and strategic storytelling. The Professor's mastermind planning, the
  emotional depth of the characters, and the high-stakes action make it super
  addictive. Every episode keeps me on edge with unexpected turns and powerful
  moments. The blend of thrill, suspense, and emotional connections within the
  team makes it more than just a heistâ€”it's a revolution. And of course, Bella
  Ciao just adds to the epic vibe!
