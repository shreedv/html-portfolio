<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey! I'm Divyashree, a second-year CSE student, currently heading into my 4th semester. I love exploring different
   areas of tech and trying out new things, from coding to building projects. I'm still in the learning phase, 
   experimenting with various technologies, and figuring out what excites me the most.</p>

<p>I'm always looking forward to creating and improving, whether it's through small projects or learning something new.
   This portfolio is a space where I showcase my progress and experiments as I grow in my journey as a developer.
   Excited for what's ahead! ðŸš€</p>
