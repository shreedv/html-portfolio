# html-portfolio
This is my first GitHub repository, where I’m sharing my HTML portfolio! It includes some basic projects I’ve built while learning and experimenting with web development. I’m exploring different aspects of coding, trying out new ideas, and looking forward to improving as I go.  Feel free to check it out and follow along on my journey!
